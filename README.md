# Scheduler Web
Website: https://shiftfix.net/

## Private project
Started as a parent duty scheduler, then expanded to three shifts per day with one to three people per shift.

## Development
- If Parcel errors, clear its cache: `npx parcel cache clean`
- Build: `npm run build` (obfuscation runs afterwards automatically; otherwise run `npm run postbuild`)
- Preview dist: `npm run preview`
