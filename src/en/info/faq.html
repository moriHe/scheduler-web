      <h3 class="text-l font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">What is the difference between the free Basic Schedule Planner and the Parent Duty Schedule Planner?</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">In short, there is no real difference between the Schedule Planner and the Parent Duty Schedule Planner. The project originated from the Parent Duty Schedule Planner and then became more generalized. The Parent Duty Schedule Planner is basically the same as the Schedule Planner with two shifts or slots.</p>

    <div>
      <h3 class="text-l font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">What is the difference between the Basic Schedule Planner and the Pro Schedule Planner?</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">The Pro Schedule Planner has 3 additional features compared to the Basic Schedule Planner. You can enter blackout periods per shift instead of per day. You can assign 1 to 3 people per shift instead of just one person. And you can define in which team sizes each individual person can work.</p>

    <div>
      <h3 class="text-l font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">I need a schedule where I assign two people per day. I don't need multiple shifts. Is that possible?</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Yes, that works great with the Basic Schedule Planner. In the preview, you can name the shifts yourself. For example, you can name them "Morning Shift", "Midday Shift", and "Evening Shift" to cover different times of day.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Or you can do it like in the Parent Duty Schedule Planner and name the shifts something like "Family 1" and "Family 2". This way you simply have two people (or groups) per day who are scheduled at the same time.</p>
